# Firebase Asynchronous Data Access Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when working with Firebase's asynchronous data fetching methods. The error arises when attempting to access data from a document snapshot before the data has fully loaded.  The example uses Javascript. 

## Problem
The primary issue is the timing of data access relative to the asynchronous nature of Firebase's `get()` method. If you attempt to access properties of `snapshot.data()` before the data has finished loading, it will result in an error because `snapshot.data()` will return `undefined`.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that the data access occurs only after the promise resolves and the data is fully available. This is achieved by correctly handling the promise returned by the `get()` method and accessing the data within the `.then()` block.  The provided `bugSolution.js` showcases the corrected implementation.
