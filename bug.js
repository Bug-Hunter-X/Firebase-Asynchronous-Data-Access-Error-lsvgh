The Firebase SDK may throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the data has fully loaded. This can occur if you're using asynchronous functions and accessing the snapshot data too early in the callback.  For example:

```javascript
db.collection('myCollection').doc('myDoc').get().then(snapshot => {
  console.log(snapshot.data().myField); // This might throw an error
});
```

The `snapshot.data()` method might return `undefined` if the data hasn't finished loading, leading to an error.
