The correct way to handle asynchronous operations with Firebase is to ensure data access is performed within the promise's `.then()` block, after the data has been fully loaded.

```javascript
db.collection('myCollection').doc('myDoc').get().then(snapshot => {
  if (snapshot.exists) {
    console.log(snapshot.data().myField); // Access data safely here
  } else {
    console.log('Document does not exist!');
  }
}).catch(error => {
  console.error('Error getting document:', error);
});
```

This revised approach first checks if the document exists using `snapshot.exists` before accessing the data. It also includes a `.catch()` block to handle any potential errors during the data fetching process. This robust approach prevents errors caused by premature data access.
